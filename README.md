# Codestars Repository

## Details
This repository is used for the Codestars iOS course. You will find your assignments for the week in this repo and will also use the repo to submit your homework going forward. We cover how to submit your homework through GitHub in class and will submit your first problem set to us directly. For now you'll be able to find this week's reading assignment and homework in the "week_0" folder.
