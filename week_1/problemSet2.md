# Codestars - Problem Set 2

Please submit your completed problem set through Github using the instructions we will cover in class this week. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **August 9th at 11:59 PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Re-read Chapters 13, 14, 18 and 19 of Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.

## Coding Exercises 

1) Create a method that returns the number of words that are in a string.

2) Create a method that takes a string as its input and returns the number of vowels that appear in the string. 

**Note: For questions 1 and 2 we are only interested in the seeing the syntax of how this method would appear if it were a part of a class. Please include your answers to both questions in a single markdown file in your Git repository (folder) that you will be using to submit this week's homework. You can read more about markdown here: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Please include this file in the root of the directory you will be using to submit your homework.**

3) Create a Shape class that has a height and width property. Include a class method that will calculate the area of the shape, where area is defined as the shape's height multiplied by its width. For this question you should submit an Xcode project that includes a .m nad h. file that correctly implements your class.

**Hint: For questions 1 and 2 you may want to search through the Apple docs to find a method on the NSString class that converts a string into an NSArray**

**Additional Hint: For question 3 you may need to use the self keyword. Don't worry if you don't get it now because we'll be covering this during our lecture on Monday.**


## Writing Assignment
Using your Medium, account write a blog post about methods and message sends in Objective-C. You should speak and give examples about the different ways methods can be sent. Describe how to create and call a method that takes multiple arguments and explain why method definitions are so verbose in Objective-C.
