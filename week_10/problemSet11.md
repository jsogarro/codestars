##Writing Exercises

1) Write a blog post on any programming based topic that is of interest to you. Topics can be on things you've learned in class, outside of class, concepts that have been having trouble understanding or a cool new technology you are interested in using or learning. Create a five-slide presentation based on this blog post. You will be using this slide deck to present your post to the class next week. You should plan for your presentation to last no more than five minutes.

##Coding Exercises

1) Continue working on your iOS apps.


##Study!
There will be a cumulative pop exam on Monday that will test your understanding of what was covered in class. Anything covered from the pre-work up until now is fair game. You can expect to answer both conceptual questions and coding challenges. If you have been doing the work each work this would be a cakewalk. :)
