# Codestars - Problem Set 3

Please submit the link to your completed problem set on Github via Slack. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **August 16th at 11:59 PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Re-read Chapters 20-23 of Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.

## Coding Exercises 

1) Explain the concept of inheritance and how the super keyword is used in Objective C.

2) Create a Square class that inherits from the Shape class that you created in **Problem Set 2** and calculate the area of that class. The formula to calculate the area of a square is area = width * height.

3) Create a Circle class that inherits from the Shape class that you created in **Problem Set 2** and calculate the area of that class. The formula to calculate the area of a circle is area = 3.14 * radius * radius.

4) Instantiate a Circle and Square class in main.m and log the area for each to the console.

**Hint: For question 2 you may need to use the super keyword and for 3 you will need to include a property for the circle's radius.**

**Additional Hint: For questions 2 and 3 you should submit an Xcode project that includes a .m and .h file that correctly implements your classes.**
