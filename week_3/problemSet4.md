# Codestars - Problem Set 4

Please submit the link to your completed problem set on Github via Slack. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **Saturday, August 22nd at 11:59 PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Read chapter 24 of Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. In addition, read chapters 1 - 3 of [Learn iOS 8 Programming from Scratch ](http://www.appcoda.com/book/learn-ios7-programming-from-scratch.html#packages) (make sure you purchase the the Objective-C version of the book for iOS 8 and purchase the book only). For both of the readings above you are to code along with the examples and submit Xcode projects containing your project code.

## Coding Exercises
1) Write a function that takes an NSSArray of strings as an argument and returns a new NSArray of the same strings capitalized. For example, if I were to pass the following array @[@"cat", @"dog", @"frog"] it would return @[@"CAT", @"DOG", @"FROG"].

2) Write a function that takes two NSArrays as arguments and returns another NSArray that is the combination of the two arrays. For example, if I pass the following arrays @[@1, @2, @3] and @[@4, @5, @6] it will return @[@1, @2, @3, @4, @5, @6].

3) Write a function that takes an NSArray of five NSDictionaries representing cars and prints out the value stored in each key. Your NSDictionary objects should include "make", "year" and "model" keys. Your function should take your array of dictionaries as an argument and log each model, make and year to the console. For example, if I have the following NSDictionary @{@"make": @"BMW", @"model": @"M6", @"year": @2015} your program should print "2015 BMW M6."
 
4) For this exercise you will be creating your first iPhone app from scratch (Congrats, you have come a long way! Now is probably a good time to pat yourself on the back). The app that you will make will be an "activity suggestion" app named whatever you want it to be called (for example I've called my app What's Happening NYC). For your app, you will create a single view iOS application that has a label and a button. The user should be able to click the button, which will randomly update the table with a suggested activity they can do in New York. You should preload your application with at least ten suggestions that will randomly be selected when the button is clicked.
 

## Writing Assignment
Using your Medium account write a blog post that explains IBOutlets and IBActions in the Cocoa Touch framework. In your blog post you should describe these concepts while walking the reader through how to create a simple "Hello World" app similar to the one that was covered in the lecture on Monday.
