Please submit the link to your completed problem set on Github via Slack. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **Sunday, October 4th at 11:59PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Read chapters 18-19 and 21 of [Learn iOS 8 Programming from Scratch ]. For the reading you are to code along with the examples and submit Xcode projects containing your project code.

## Exercises

1) Write a blog post about UICollectionViews, how they are both similar and different to UITableViews. Your post should detail how to pass data from a ViewController containing a UITableView or UICollectionView to another UIViewController. Explain what the methods "dequeueReusableCellwithIdentifier, " "prepareForSegue," and "numberOfRowsInSection" are used for and how they work. You should detail which protocols these methods come from and briefly explain the concept of prototocols. Explain what the "destinationViewController" and segue indentifier represent in the prepareForSegue method.

2) Create an application that has a collection view displaying a list of your top ten favorite albums of all time. Each collection view cell should have the album's artwork. When a user clicks on a cell it should launch a detail view that contains a larger image of the album cover, the year the album was released, its title and a quick blurb about why you love the album so much.

3) Continue working on your project from class. If you haven't done so already, submit your app to Testflight. You  can submit your application by using the following tutorial [Test Flight for Beta Testing](http://www.raywenderlich.com/101790/ios-beta-testing-with-testflight-tutorial).
