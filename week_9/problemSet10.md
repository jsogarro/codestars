Please submit the link to your completed problem set on Github via Slack. The deadline to submit your answers to this problem set is **Sunday, October 11th at 11:59PM**.

## Reading Assignment
Read chapters 28, 29 and 22 of [Learn iOS 8 Programming from Scratch ]. For the reading you are to code along with the examples and submit Xcode projects containing your project code. Please make sure to actually write the code and not copy and paste the examples from the book.

## Writing Exercises
1) Based on the lecture from last week, write a blog post using your Medium account explaining what databases are. Explain what SQL is and how it is used to query data from a database. Describe what primary keys and foreign keys are. Also explain the concept of joins and how foreign keys used to perform them. You should also explain what a database schema is. In addition, briefly explain what NoSQL databases and graph database are. How are they different from relational databases?
2) Using your Medium account write a second blog post, based on last night's lecture, that explains what servers are. Also explain HTTP, REST, the four primary HTTP verbs and how they relate to CRUD. Describe the life cycle of an HTTP request and response. Be sure to explain the roles of the client and the server. Be sure to detail how JSON fits into the equation. Last, explain what Parse is and how we can use it to create a back-end for our iOS apps.

## Coding Exercises
1) Add a tab bar to the app that you built last week. Create a second tab that contains a table view that displays ten music genres (i.e. Country, Rock, R&B, Electronic, Hip Hop, etc.). When the user clicks the table view cell you should display a web view that displays the Wikipedia page for each of these genres. Include another tab that contains a detail view that contains the image, name and a brief description of who you consider to be the greatest musician of all time and why. You should include a button that the user can click to display another view that contains the Wikipedia article on this artist. Make sure that your app also has a launch screen.
2) Continue working on your iOS apps. If you haven't done so already, submit your app to Testflight. You can submit your application by using the following tutorial [Test Flight for Beta Testing](http://www.raywenderlich.com/101790/ios-beta-testing-with-testflight-tutorial). If you're having trouble submitting your app we'll be reviewing this process in class.
